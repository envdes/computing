## Overview 

### Computing Resources

Members of our lab have access to the following High Performance Computing (HPC) resources:

- [ARCHER2](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/) (a world class advanced computing resource for UK researchers)
- [Bede](https://n8cir.org.uk/supporting-research/facilities/bede/) (the [N8 CIR](https://n8cir.org.uk/about/)’s new high performance computing platform)
- [CSF](https://ri.itservices.manchester.ac.uk/csf3/) (Computational Shared Facility, the HPC cluster at The University of Manchester, [~8,644 cores + 100 GPUs](https://ri.itservices.manchester.ac.uk/csf3/overview/configuration/))

We also have an in-house GPU workstation (NVIDIA® RTXTM A5000, 24 GB GDDR6)
